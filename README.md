# Proof of NP-completeness of CLIQUE

This project implements the transformation of a CLIQUE instance to a 3-SAT instance, proving the NP-completeness of the CLIQUE problem.  
In the docs folder you can find both a report and a presentation in Spanish with the proof in an elaborate theoretical form.  

This is a student project for the subject Complejidad Computacional at University of La Laguna.
